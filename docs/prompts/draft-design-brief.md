Thoroughly analyze the UI in this screenshot and describe it in as much detail as you can to hand over from a UI designer to a developer. The brief should cover both light and dark mode and contain responsive breakpoints matching Tailwind CSS defaults. Output characteristics as structured JSONC.

For colors, extract a rough palette and only detail accents and complex media. The goal is to use only 2 palettes: primary and secondary similar to Tailwind colors. Alongside these 2, you can define any number of grays and accent colors for more complex UI (gradients, shadows, SVGs, etc.).

End with a prompt explaining how to implement the UI for a developer, but don't mention any tech specs; only a brief of the UI to be implemented and the token rules + usage. Output the prompt as a Markdown code block.
